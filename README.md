An interactive storefront that runs in the console using node.

#How It Works

##Bamazon Customer This program consists of three seperate, but related apps however, this application created only runs through the first requirement. BamazonCustomer.js, allows a "customer" to place an order from the Bamazon store. A check is then performed on the store inventory and the customer is either alerted that their order cannot be completed, or they are shown the total amount owed . The quantity ordered by the customer is deducted from the store quantity (which is stored in a SQL table). If the item does not have enough in stock, you will then get an alert saying that there is not enough items in stock and return you to the orginal prompt.
